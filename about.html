        Since its inception in 2000, the International Community School Ghana
        has committed itself to educating and developing the young people
        entrusted to our care by our diverse community of families. Our values
        of hard work, respect for one another, our child-friendly environment,
        and teamwork guides our daily processes. Our goal is to be a model
        International School where teachers, staff, students, and parents work
        together to create and foster an educational center of excellence. We
        welcome all who share our ethos and IDEALS (Internationalism, Democracy,
        Environment, Adventure, Leadership, and Service). This is a commitment
        beyond academic excellence to personal development, responsibility,
        service to God and mankind, a challenge of self, and international
        mindedness and understanding. AKWAABA!

    <div id="aboutstory">
      <p>
        The International Community School, Ghana was founded by Dr. & Mrs.
        Yeboah upon their return from the USA. The Yeboahs had come back to
        Ghana after having spent seven years studying and living in the USA.
        Having difficulties finding a school that in their view was a good fit
        for their children transitioning from a good suburban school in the USA,
        they decided to start one themselves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        International Community School (ICS-G), formally opened its doors to the
        public with seven students in January 2000. ICS-K now has over 1000
        students from Preschool through High School. We pride ourselves in our
        rich cultural diversity, with our student body consisting of learners
        from more than 30 different nationalities. A student’s learning
        environment is important, and ICS provides the perfect environment with
        our beautiful 20-acre campus outfitted with sizeable classrooms,
        well-stocked libraries, art rooms, computer labs, and comfortable
        boarding houses, amongst many other facilities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Excellence in education is our essence. ICS-G is an independent,
        co-educational institution that follows the British System of Education,
        which we believe provides the resources necessary for academic rigor, as
        well as the necessary skills of inquiry, creativity, and initiative to
        produce a well-rounded learner. Our school is a University of Cambridge
        International School and is therefore accredited to run both the
        International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)
        programme and A-Level programme at the High School level. Both of these
        programs are externally moderated by the University of Cambridge, UK.
        Our graduates attend top universities around the world, such as Brown
        University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA, The
        University of Stirling in the UK, amongst many illustrious others.
